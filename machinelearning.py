#-- STEPS
# 1. Import the data
# 2. Clean the data
# 3. Split the data into Training/Test sets
# 4. Create a model ( algorithms to use -- we will use scikit)
# 5. Train the model
# 6. make predictions
# 7. evaluate and improve


#--- TOOLS & LIBRARIES 4 machine learning
1.Numpy --- provides a multidimensional array
2.Pandas --- data analysis which produces a data frame( a two dimensional data structure similar to an excel spreadsheet)
3.MatPlotLib --- a two dimensional ploting library for creating graphs and plots
4.Scikit-Learn --- most popular machine learning and provides all common lib such as decisiontrees, neuro

------JUPYTER -----
The environment used in machine learning to write code because u need to frequently inspect the data
